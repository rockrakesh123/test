Alright, let’s go through this clearly:

What is a DaemonSet?

A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a pod runs on every node (or on selected nodes) in a Kubernetes cluster.

When you add a new node to the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically adds the pod to that new node.

When a node is removed, the pod is also removed.


Typical use cases of DaemonSet:

Running log collection agents (like Fluentd, Logstash) on every node.

Running monitoring agents (like Prometheus Node Exporter) on every node.

Running storage plugins or networking daemons (like CNI plugins).

Sample Task for DaemonSet

Goal:
Create a DaemonSet to install a simple log collector (busybox) that continuously logs "Hello from node" every 5 seconds on every node.


---

1. DaemonSet YAML Example

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: hello-daemon
  namespace: default
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: hello-daemon
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: hello-daemon
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: busybox
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do echo Hello from node; sleep 5; done"]


---

Explanation:

busybox container will run a shell loop (while true) printing "Hello from node" every 5 seconds.

It will be deployed once on every node automatically by Kubernetes.



---

How to create it:

1. Save the YAML to a file, e.g., daemonset.yaml


2. Apply it:

kubectl apply -f daemonset.yaml


3. Check running pods:

kubectl get pods -o wide

You’ll see one pod per node!

Perfect! Let’s create a real-world DaemonSet task:
This time, we’ll simulate a log collector using Fluentd running on every Kubernetes node — just like how companies collect logs from all nodes.


---

Task: Deploy Fluentd as a DaemonSet to collect logs from all nodes


---

1. Fluentd DaemonSet YAML example

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-ds
  namespace: kube-system  # Because it's an infra component
  labels:
    k8s-app: fluentd-logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: fluentd-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: fluentd-pod
    spec:
      tolerations:   # This allows it to run on master nodes if needed
      - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
        operator: "Exists"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      containers:
      - name: fluentd
        image: fluent/fluentd:v1.14-1
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 200Mi
            cpu: 100m
          requests:
            memory: 100Mi
            cpu: 50m
        volumeMounts:
        - name: varlog
          mountPath: /var/log
        - name: varlibdockercontainers
          mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: varlog
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log
      - name: varlibdockercontainers
        hostPath:
          path: /var/lib/docker/containers

2. Steps to deploy:

1. Save this YAML file, name it fluentd-daemonset.yaml


2. Deploy it:

kubectl apply -f fluentd-daemonset.yaml


3. Verify pods are running:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o wide

You should see one Fluentd pod per node!
